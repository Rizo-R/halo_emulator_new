# halo_emulator_new
Updated (public) version of my halo emulator

* All folders with data have been copied to Github
* The "hmf_params_final" folder contains all fits for non-zero redshifts that I had time to construct (some of them might be inaccurate so need to be reran, plot the predictions to see which)
* The "hmf_params" folder contains my (old) fits for z=0 and z=0.0424 (the first two redshifts in the list), and interpolate.py uses this folder
* To run properly, this code also needs "covmat" and "mcmc_samples" folders, which can be downloaded at https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XBlZhAv6U0ec5WVSc5aDYaEZXP3M4MbV/view?usp=sharing
